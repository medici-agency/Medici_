= Why Shortcode Block? =

WordPress Gutenberg editor sanitizes HTML blocks using KSES, which removes:
- `<form>` tags
- `<input>` elements
- `<select>` and `<option>` tags
- Various attributes like `placeholder`, `required`

By using a shortcode, the form HTML is generated by PHP at runtime, completely bypassing this sanitization.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu
3. Go to Medici Forms > Add New to create your first form
